=== fw4spl_0.9.2.2 ( diff from fw4spl_0.9.2.1 ) 20/06/2013 ===
 
 * Transplanted from fw4spl_0.9.1.4.:
  * Added a getAttribute() template method on fwAtoms/Object.
  * fixed on fwAtoms/Object attributes and metaInfos
  * Added version number on atom (see fwAtoms/Base.hpp) 
  * Updated fwCore::SpyLogger to remove logger global severity.   
  * Updated CompareObjects visitor for BufferObject   
  * Created a new library fwAtomsPatch which contains the base interface to transform atoms from a version to an other into a context.  
  * Added a version generator utility to generate .versions files (files used by the patch system).
  * Added MedicalData pacth system to VRRender
  * Updated ioAtoms reader(SReader)/writer(SWriter) to use the patch system.
  * Added verison on Atom writers/readers(Hdf5 reader/writer and BoostIO writer/reader). 
  * Added test for getAttribute() template method.

  * Cleaned fwZip: removed old and deprecated class/API, group minizip classes.
  * 'MediacalData' object version change to V2
  * Updated fwData::Reconstruction to version 2 (some attributes have been removed).
  * Fixed duplicated extension filename in objWriter.
  * Added atoms_version and writer_version in TF files (json files)
  
 * Patch system : 
  * Create patch to transform atoms object into 'MediacalData' context from version V1 to version V2.

  * Added patchMedicalData bundle.
  * Updated VRRender config to use MedicalData patch system.

 * Memory dump system
  * BufferManager, BufferObject and depending classes has been moved to fwMemory library. BufferObject is not self-sufficient anymore : (Re)Allocation/destruction has been delegated to BufferManager.
  * Updated BufferManager and BufferObject API to allow “lazy loading” and to improve dumped data access :
   * A BufferObject may be initialised with a ‘stream factory’, allowing to load data in ‘dumped’ or ‘lazy loaded’ state, i.e. the data will be really loaded when needed (for example when the BufferObject is locked)
   * When a buffer has been lazy-loaded or dumped by the buffer manager, an internal structure stores information about the dumped state : the filesystem path of the data (if applicable), and the format of this file (if applicable). This can be useful to reuse filesystem data if needed. For example, fwAtomsBoostIO’s writer creates hardlinks to these files when possible.
   * If a BufferObject user need an access to the data, it is possible to get a stream to it, regardless of and without changing the buffer state. For example, fwAtomsBoostIO’s Writer use this mechanism to copy data from buffers when a BufferObject is not dumped or the dumped file do not have a compatible format for hardlinking.
 * fwMemory has been made thread-safe :
  * Buffer management runs in a dedicated thread
  * BufferManager has an asynchronous API, based on boost::shared_future
  * Naive factories has been updated to fwCore's one

 * IO
  * Added DICOM LazyReader in vtkGdcmIO.
  * Added VTK/VTI Lazy Image Reader in fwVtkIO.
  * Added lazy ability to json(z)/xml(z) data Reader in fwAtomsBoostIO.
  * fwAtomsBoostIO : fixed archive buffer filename and archive's buffers dir name
   * A new name for each buffer is generated in order to avoid to have several buffer using the same file name.
   * The postfix -json or -xml has been appended to buffers dir name, to avoid data overwrite when saving to archive in the same place with the same name but with a different base format.

 * UI
  * Added an example of asynchronous UI in DumpEditor using QFutureWatcher

=== fw4spl_0.9.1.0 ( diff from fw4spl_0.9.0.2 ) 29/11/2012 ===

 * Thread:
  * Created new fwThread library that provides few tools to execute asynchronous tasks on different threads.
  * Created fwThread::Worker. This class creates and manages a thread. Thanks to the post method it is possible to execute handlers on.
  * Created fwThread::TaskHandler. This class encapsulates packaged task and it is used to post easily a task on a worker
  * Created fwThread::Timer. The Timer class provides single-shot or repetitive timers. A Timer triggers a function once after a delay, or periodically, inside the worker loop. The delay or the period is defined by the duration attribute.

 * Communication:
  * Added new fwCom library. This library provides a set of tools dedicated to communication. These communications are based on Signal and slots concept (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots). fwCom provides the following features :
   * function and method wrapping
   * direct slot calling
   * asynchronous slot calling
   * ability to work with multiple threads
   * auto-deconnection of slot and signals
   * arguments loss between slots and signals
  * fwCom::Slot is wrappers for a function or a class method that can be attached to a fwThread::Worker. The purpose of this class is to provide synchronous and asynchronous mecanisms for method and function calling.
  * fwCom::Slots is a structure that contains a mapping between a key and a Slot
  * fwCom::HasSlots manages a fwCom::Slots
  * fwCom::Signal allows to perform grouped calls on slots.  In this purpose, Signal provides a mechanism to connect slots to itself.
  * fwCom::Signals is a structure that contains a mapping between a key and a Signal
  * fwCom::HasSignals manages a fwCom::Signals
  * The connection of a Slot to a Signal returns a Connection handler. Connection provides a mechanism which allows to temporarily disable a Slot in a Signal. The slot stays connected to the Signal, but it will not be triggered while the Connection is blocked :
  * Add new xxx.vrdc file that are parsed by a variadic_parser (fwCom/scripts/variadic_parser.py) to generate some hpp/hxx files (manipulation of template).

 * fwData:
  * Updated Object to inherit of HasSignal
  * all objects have a signal objectModifiedSig to emit object modification

 * fwServices:
  * IService:
   * Updated IService to have an associated worker and thus an associated thread
   * Updated IService to inherit of HasSignal and HasSlots
   * Updated IService to remove old communication system
   * Updated IService to rename update(msg) to receive(msg)
   * Added slots start, stop, receive, update, swap on IService. If these methods (receive excepted) are not call in thread associated to the service, the slot version is called.
   * Add IService::getObjSrvConnections method to propose signal/slot connections between a service and his associated object
  * Add new structure ActiveWorkers to register worker in f4s
  * Added macros for notification: fwServicesNotifyMsgMacro and fwServicesBlockAndNotifyMsgMacro
  * Modify IEditionService::notify to use this macros.

 * Log:

  * Support new TF structure for PoC06Scene2DTF
  * Added TransferFunction helper to create a drawing TF

 * BufferObject / IBufferManager
  * Added fwTools::BufferObject : Base class for FW4SPL buffers. Keep a pointer to a buffer and it's allocation policy (new or malloc) without any cleverness about allocating/destroying the buffer. Users of this class needs to take care about allocation and destruction by themselves. BufferObject class has a BufferManager and Locks mechanism, Allowing to trigger special treatments on various events on BufferObjects (allocation, reallocation, destruction, swapping, locking, unlocking) (see doxygen for more information).
  * Added fwTools::IBufferManager : Provides interface for a buffer manager. A BufferManager is able to hook BufferObjects actions an to change it's behaviors. (see doxygen for more information)
  * Updated fwData::Array to use fwTools::BufferObject
  * Added new helper fwdata::ObjectLock : a simple helper to lock specific object, manages : Image, Mesh, Array, Reconstruction and Acquisition.
  * Removed few critical methods of basic structures (fwData::Array, fwData::Mesh and fwData::Image) according to buffer lock mecanism. These methods are now proposed by helpers (fwComEd::helper::Array, fwComEd::helper::Mesh, fwComEd::helper::Image) and manage buffer lock process.
  * Support buffer lock process in many helpers/services ( MeshGenerator, vtk conversion, itk conversion, serialization, etc )

 * Dump managment
  * Added an implementation of fwTools::IBufferManager with fwMemory::BufferManager : This implementation purpose is to manage memory load, freeing memory and restoring freed buffers as needed. A dump policy is used to trigger memory freeing process. The restore process is always triggers when a lock is requested on a dumped buffer. Available policies :
   * NeverDump : This policy will never take the initiative to free memory. This is the policy used when no automatic memory management is wanted. Memory will be dumped on demand.
   * AlwaysDump : This policy will dump buffers as often as possible. As soon as a buffer is released (ie the lock count become zero), it will be dumped.
   * BarrierDump : This policy defines a memory usage barrier and will try to keep the managed buffers memory usage under this barrier.
   * ValveDump : This policy is monitoring system memory usage and will trigger memory dump when the amount of system free memory is lower than the minFreeMem parameter. An hysteresis parameter exists to free more memory when the process is triggered. If the free system memory amount is lower than the minFreeMem, this policy will try to reach minFreeMem + hysteresisOffset bytes of free memory.
  * Updated darwin memory tool : take in account inactive memory as free memory
  * Activate BarrierDump during fwXML serialization if fwMemory::BufferManager with NeverDump policy is used.
