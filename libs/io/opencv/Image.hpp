 * really recommended to detach a buffer allocated by a cv::Mat, cause we may not free it in the same way than OpenCV.
 * Instead you can allocate a data::Image of the correct size/type, and then use moveToCv() to wrap the image
 * with a cv::Mat. This way every modification made to the buffer will be applied to the data::Image, and you
 * don't need an extra stage to get back your modified image.
