 * @brief This class implements one static method that call an image type dispatcher to extrude voxels that are
 * inside a mesh.
 *
 * The only way to use this class is to call @ref extrude(const data::Image::sptr&, const data::Mesh::csptr&),
 * wich sets all voxels inside of the mesh to an empty value. To compute this quickly, we loop over two dimensions out
 * of three, for each voxel, we launch a ray on the third dimension and get a list of intersections between this ray,
 * and triangles of the mesh. After that, we iterate over the voxel line on the third dimension and look where it's
 * located relatively to intersections, it allows to know if the voxel is inside or outside of the mesh.
 *
 * @pre The input image must be in 3D.
 * @pre Input meshes must have cells with 3 or 4 points.
 * @warning The image and meshes must be used without transformation matrices in 3D scene, no matrices are used here.
