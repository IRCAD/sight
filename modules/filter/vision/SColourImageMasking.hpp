 * @brief   Service that learns a foreground and background color model and allow to segment the foreground on a new
 * image using an Expectation Maximization algorithm.
 *
 * @see service::IFilter
 *
 * @section Slots Slots
 * - \b setBackground() : Slot to set the background image to learn the background model color
 * - \b setForeground() : Slot to set the foreground image to learn the foreground model color
 * - \b setThreshold(int threshold) : Slot to set the threshold value to get the final binary image
 * - \b setNoiseLevel(double noiseLevel) : Slot to set the noise level added in the learning steps
 * - \b setBackgroundComponents(int bgComponents) : Slot to set the number of background components learned
 * - \b setForegroundComponents(int fgComponents) : Slot to set the number of foreground components learned
 * - \b clearMaskTL() : Slot to clear the output foreground mask timeline and reset the last timestamp.

 * @subsection Input Input
 * - \b mask [sight::data::Image] : mask image to perform image segmentation in
 * - \b videoTL [sight::data::FrameTL] : Timeline to extract image from a video to perform the learning steps
 *
 * @subsection In-Out In-Out
 * - \b videoMaskTL [sight::data::FrameTL] : Timeline to put masks inside where the foreground is segmented (outside of
 * the
 * mask = 0)
 *
 * @subsection Configuration Configuration
 * - \b scaleFactor (optional)(default: 1.0) : factor to scale the image to perform image masking on
 * - \b noise (optional)(default: 0.0) : standard deviation value for the additive noise used during the foreground
 * learning step. It allows to perform a more robust learning step by providing different values close to the initial
 * pixel. It is sometimes needed when real values are a little bit different than the given input image used during the
 * learning step. For example, to avoid missing pixels when brightness or shadows is changing.
 * - \b foregroundComponents (optional)(default: 5) : number of components learned in the foreground color model
 * - \b backgroundComponents (optional)(default: 5) : number of components learned in the foreground color model
 * - \b HSV (optional) : values in HSV defined by <lower>(default: 0,0,0) and <upper> (default: 255,255,255) tags
 * allowing to compute automatically the mask during the foreground color model learning step
