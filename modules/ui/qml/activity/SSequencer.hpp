 * @brief This editor displays an activity stepper that allows to select the activity to launch, and display the
 * current selection
 *
 * The order of the activities is given in the Qml file.
 *
 * ActivitySeries are created for each activity using the data produced by the previous activities. This activities are
 * stored in the current SeriesDB.
 *
 * This service should be associated to the SView to display the current activity
 *
 * @section Signal Signal
 * - \b activityCreated(data::ActivitySeries::sptr) : This signal is emitted when an activity is created (using
 *   next() or previous().
 * - \b dataRequired() : This signal is emitted when the activity can not be launch because it requires data.
 *
 * @section Slots Slots
 * - \b goTo(int) : Create the activity series at the given index
 * - \b checkNext() : Check if the next activities can be enabled
 *
 * @section Config Configuration
 *
 * @subsection Qml Qml Configuration
 *
 * To use this service, import 'uiActivitiesQml' in your qml file and use the ActivitySequencer object:
 *
 * @code{.qml}
 *  ActivitySequencer {
        activityIdsList: activityLauncher.activityIdsList
        activityNameList: activityLauncher.activityNameList

        onServiceCreated: {
            appManager.onServiceCreated(srv)
        }
    }
    @endcode
 * - \n activityIdsList: identifiers of the activities to launch
 * - \n activityNameList: name of the activities to launch, that will be displays in the stepper
 *
 * @subsection Cpp C++ Configuration
 *
 * Listen the creation of the service in your AppManager with the method "onServiceCreated(srv)" and then associate the
 * the seriesDB inout and register the service.
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
     m_activitySequencer->setInOut(m_seriesDB, "seriesDB", true);
   @endcode
 *
 *  @subsubsection In-Out In-Out
 * - \b seriesDB [sight::data::SeriesDB]: used to store the ActivitySeries of the managed activities
